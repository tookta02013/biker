        <p>The Service Provider has respected the privacy of users and has been well aware that users intended to receive security
          in using applications, and the data obtained by the Service Provider under the agreed terms and conditions shall
          be used for the purpose of users only, and the Service Provider shall operate its businesses under the strict measures
          of security protection, including prevention from any use of the data without receiving prior permissions from
          users. The Privacy Policy, as appeared below, shall be applicable to accounts of users and data as given by users
          with this Application. Collection of Personal Data: Regarding the registration or use of services on applications,
          the Service Provider needed to ask for the personal data of users such as first names and last names, email addresses,
          cellphone numbers, addresses, etc., for continuous operation of the application system. In case, users have exercised
          their rights to redeem points for rewards and privileges, the Service Provider may ask for additional personal
          data such as genders, date of birth, addresses, personal preferences, etc. Users acknowledged that the personal
          data completed for use on applications shall be sent through the Internet which is the public networking system;
          whereas, the Service Provider shall use measures and its due care to prevent the third parties from accessing such
          personal data. However, the Service Provider reserved its rights to assume no responsibility for any damage resulting
          from the third parties’ viewing and/or use of such data of users. Use of Personal Data: Users shall have their
          rights of privacy in their data, and the Service Provider shall not permit any disclosure of data of users to the
          third parties other than employees authorized by the Service Provider. The Service Provider shall use the personal
          data of users as may be suitable for the purposes of communication, public relations, marketing or statistical
          use of data. The Service Provider shall not sell or disseminate the collected personal data of users to the third
          parties unless receiving acknowledgment from users only or by means of disclosure thereof as prescribed by laws
          or by orders of the competent government officers. Access to and Change of Data: 1. Users may access, examine or
          change their personal data as per the scope prescribed by the Service Provider through the Application. 2. Personal
          data of users completed for use shall be the true data in all respects and such personal data shall always be updated.
          3. When accounts of users have been cancelled, the Service Provider shall still keep the account data of users
          in the database as prescribed by laws for the purposes of auditing in case of fraud and avoiding the closing of
          old accounts and opening of new accounts. However, when accounts of users have been cancelled, the Service Provider
          shall no longer use the account data of users, and shall not disclose the data to any person or organization, or
          shall not use the data in the manner which may cause any damage to users, except in the event that it is required
          to use the data of users in the inquiry or in the legal processes or by orders of the competent government officers.
          Revision of the Privacy Policy: - The Service Provider may revise, change or amend the Privacy Policy in the future
          without giving any prior notice thereof to users.</p>
